# Welcome to SunnySales POS
This project was initially created with the idea of helping small businesses and individuals manage and increase their
sales through a system with unique features such as AI implementation and real-time sales data.

In this repository, you will be able to see all the used files in a unique folder, so it is easier for you to read code. The whole 
project is located on a private repo for security purposes.

To start understanding the project I recommend you go first through the _layout.jsx and index.jsx.

I hope you enjoy it!
